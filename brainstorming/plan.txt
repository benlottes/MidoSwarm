PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT:
0. Decisions and Planning
	- broad idea
	- hone in on outlines of approach
	- make decisions
	- create plan
	- jupyter notebook
	

1. Engine Creation
	- Create map basics
	- Create different materials
	- Create models for Midos
	- Create all the internals for creatures (hunger, thirst, etc)
	- Create actions for creatures and senses (preferably very flexible)
	- Create graphical output (pics, gifs, videos)
	- Create procedural generation

2. Trial creation
	- Create the behavior of objects over time
	- Create time length of trials and pass/fail conditions

3. Brain Creation
	- Deliberate upon architectures (NEAT)
	- Create template RNNs for each Mido
	- Map inputs and outputs
	- Create genes and mutation rates 
	- Test (purely genetic algorithms)
	- Repeat until satisfactory

4. Reward Creation
	- Deliberate upon architectures, techniques, and rewards
	- Create and test different implementations
	- Repeat until satisfactory

5. Polish
	- Spruce up graphics
	- add various QoL improvements or niceties
	- Perhaps UI?
